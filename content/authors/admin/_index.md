My name is Miltiadis (Miltos) Kofinas
<sup>{{< staticref "https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&tl=en&text=%CE%9C%CE%B9%CE%BB%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B7%CF%82%20(%CE%9C%CE%AF%CE%BB%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82)%20%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%82&op=translate" "newtab" >}}{{< icon name="volume-up" pack="fas" >}}{{< /staticref >}}</sup>
and I am a PhD student in the [Video & Image Sense
Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/) at the University of Amsterdam, supervised
by [Efstratios Gavves](https://egavves.com/).
My research focuses on future spatio-temporal forecasting, with applications on
forecasting for autonomous vehicles.
My research interests include graph neural networks,
temporal dynamics, geometric deep learning and equivariant representations.

Prior to my PhD, I received a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering
from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. For my Diploma thesis,
I researched the topic of Scene Graph Generation using Graph Neural Networks,
supervised by [Christos Diou](https://diou.github.io/) and [Anastasios Delopoulos](https://mug.ee.auth.gr/people/anastasios-delopoulos/).
During my studies, I was a computer vision & machine learning engineer at
[P.A.N.D.O.R.A. Robotics](https://pandora.ee.auth.gr/pandora-robotics/).
