      <!-- Visual Scene Graph Generation using Graph Transformer Networks -->

      <!-- * Mathematical formulation of a novel abstract Graph Network layer for visual scene graph generation that explicitly utilizes both local and global information on the graph space. -->
      <!-- * Experiments on various architectures to maximize relevant information propagation across graph vertices and edges. -->
      <!-- * Implementation of a multilayer Graph Network that effectively stacks Graph Network layers to increase network performance. -->
      <!-- * Use of global information via Transformer blocks that attentively gather global context. -->
      <!-- * Introduction of a self-attentive relationship pruning network that effectively samples meaningful relationships. -->

      <!-- The modules listed below are part of teamwork and team effort. The software is written mostly in C++, using the OpenCV library and on top of the ROS framework. The various testing modules are written in Python. -->

      <!-- * Development of a generic image classification API for victim detection, using RGB-D sensor data. Classification using a combination of HOG features, Color Histogram features from many different color spaces (e.g. HSV, CIELab) and SIFT features with Bag of Words models. Data augmentation using a set of Affine Transformations, random sampling and color jittering. Training and testing using various classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (linear and non-linear), Random Forests and Multilayer Perceptrons. -->
      <!-- * Motion detection using Gaussian Mixture-based Background/Foreground Segmentation Algorithms. -->
      <!-- * Soft obstacle detection from RGB-D sensor data using Haar wavelets and Hough Transform. -->
      <!-- * Hard obstacle detection from RGB-D sensor data using Point Cloud transformations for the creation of local elevation maps and various convolutional kernels for the creation of traversability maps, given the shape, as well as the kinematics and dynamics of the UGV. -->
      <!-- * Development of a benchmark testing API for the performance evaluation of computer vision algorithms under various environmental conditions, such as room lighting or camera angle and distance from the objects to be detected. -->
